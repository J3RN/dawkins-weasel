# Dawkins' Weasel

This is my implementation of Dawkins' weasel. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

While reading [The Blind Watchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker) by Richard Dawkins, I came to the passage where he describes creating a program that iteratively works towards creating the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and was inspired to try to create just such a program. It turns out that these programs are collectively referred to as [Dawkins' weasel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program), or "weasel programs."

## Running

My solution is written in C, with no dependencies. The only prerequisite is `gcc`.

To run, simply compile the code:

```bash
gcc -o main main.c
```

And execute it:

```bash
./main
```
